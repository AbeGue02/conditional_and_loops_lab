# Conditionals and Loops Lab



## - Grade Assigner -

Create an if/else if/else conditional that takes in a numeric grade and assigns it a letter value, logging the letter to your console. If a grade is a 90 or above, it returns an A. If it is between 80 and 89, the student recieves a B. 70-79 will give you a C. From 65 to 69 gives a D, and below a 65 returns a Failing mark. Finally, you should have a catching message that returns "Please enter a valid grade" if the inputed value is not a number


## - ATM Function

Create 3 values, a checkingAccount, a savingsAccount, and an action type, then assign each account to have any amount of $$$ in it. Then, make a switch statement that has at least 3 different actions: Withdraw, Deposit, and Transfer. If you have a case of Withdraw, subtract $100 from one of your accounts. If your case is Deposit, add $100 to an account. If you choose Transfer, take away 100 from one account and add it to the other.
